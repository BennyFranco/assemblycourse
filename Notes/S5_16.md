# x86 SIMD and Floating Point Registers

NOTE: SIMD -> Simple Instruction Multiple Data

## MMX Registers

* Pentium processors where the first to have them.
* For advanced multimedia and communication applications.
* 8 64-bit MMX registers

MMX instructions operate in parallel on the data values conteined in the MMX registers. The MMX are aliases to the registers uses by the FPU (Floating Point Unit)

The 8086 arch also contains 8 128-bit registers called XMM registers used to streaming to SIMD instructions set.

## FPU (Floating Point Unit)

Performs high-speed floating point arithmetic operations at one time a separate core was required for this. From i486, the FPU was integrated in the main CPU Chip.

There are 8 -bit data registers from ST(0) - ST(7) and two 48 - bit Pointer registers, the **FPU Instruction Pointer** and the **FPU Data Pointer**

Also three 16-bit Control registers named **Tag register, Control Register and Status register**

The FPU is sometimes called the x87 architecture; the FPU use eight data registers organized as a stack or arithmetic instructions are executed using either implicit or explicit operations relative to the top of this stack.
